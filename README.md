## Technical
I have built my portfolio with focus in SSR and SEO. I have therefore used Next.js to achieve SSR and tried to keep away from client components as much as possiple. 

Almost all text shown is saved in a JSON file which makes it easy to both change and add additional laungages which is a future goal.

## TODO
* Improve image load time
* Fade in animations (Possible SEO implications)
